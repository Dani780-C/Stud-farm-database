# Stud-farm-database

Stud farm database project combines SQL and PL/SQL to operate on different queries. The main branch contains a document file([Project Presentation](https://github.com/Dani780-C/Stud-farm-database/blob/main/232_Cirlan_Daniel_proiect.docx)) where are the general presentation and a full perspective for the relational database and a text file([Source Code](https://github.com/Dani780-C/Stud-farm-database/blob/main/232_Cirlan_Daniel_sursa.txt)) that shows full code in SQL and PL/SQL.

SQL was used to:
 *create all tables*
 *add all needed constraints*
 *insert data in tables for future queries*
 *write small chunks of code inside the code written in PL/SQL*
 
PL/SQL was used to:
 *create all basic and advanced queries*
 *Support for Object-Oriented Programming*
 *to make the idea of solving easier to understand*
